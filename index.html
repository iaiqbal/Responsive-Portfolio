            <p><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Ibrahim" class="catimage"> Hello! My name is Ibrahim Iqbal. I was born in Lahore, Pakistan but moved to the states at a rather young age of 10. I've lived in Houston my entire life so far. I enjoy working out, hiking, programming, traveling and spending times with friends.</p>
            <p>I've always found myself fascinated by the world of coding. It's something that is intuitive to me and not at the same time. I find myself attracted to the entirety of it; however, when the going gets tough, the difficulity of it deters me from flourishing as much as I know I would be able to.</p>
            <p>This is why I've enrolled in the UT Programming Bootcamp! I feel as though the structure of the program will aid me in pushing through the difficulties of coding allowing me to become the coder I know I'm destined to be.</p>
